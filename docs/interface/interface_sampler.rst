Samplers and Minimisers
=================================================

We provide tools to interface the likelihood with the two most commonly used MCMC samplers in cosmology: `Cobaya <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya>`_ and `MontePython <https://baudren.github.io/montepython.html>`_.
Moreover, we show how the likelihood can be interfaced with tools that explicitly exploit its differentiability: `BlackJAX <https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax>`_ and `Optax <https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax>`_.

Cobaya
-------------------------------------------------

cobaya, interactive, command line.

MontePython
-------------------------------------------------

montepython, a bit of a pain but can be done.

BlackJAX
-------------------------------------------------

eh whatever

Optax
-------------------------------------------------

make sure to cast params to N(0, 1)
